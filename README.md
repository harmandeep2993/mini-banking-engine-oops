# 🏦 OOP Mini Banking System Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This project was built to understand the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how they can be applied to model real-world systems.

The system simulates a simplified banking engine with customer management and account operations.

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

✔️ OOP fundamentals (Classes, Composition, Encapsulation)

✔️ Unique customer identity management

✔️ Business rule enforcement (max 5 accounts per customer)

✔️ Automatic account number generation

✔️ Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer logic

✔️ Standardized transaction logging

✔️ Freeze / Unfreeze account control

## 📂 Project Structure 

    models/
    |   customer.py
    |   account.py
    main.py

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

✔️ Composition (Customer owns BankAccount)

✔️ Class-level counters for ID generation

✔️ Business rule validation

✔️ Transaction logging system

✔️ Separation of concerns

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to move beyond basic scripting and understand how real-world backend systems (such as banking platforms) are structured and implemented.

It reflects foundational backend engineering and system design thinking.
